		    	While not as free-spirited an option as traveling fully alone, tour groups specifically for teenagers are a good way to get out of your comfort zone, learn more about travel, and make new friends. Traveling as part of a group also means your hotels, food, transportation, and activities are already organized for you.

		    	Many schools offer tours as part of their foreign language classes. Ask a foreign language teacher if your school sponsors such a trip. If your school does offer one, it can be one of the easiest and best tour opportunities for you. You'll likely already have friends on the tour and the chaperones are usually teachers. If you do go with your school, the rest of the steps here are likely already handled.

		    	There are an increasing number of companies offering guided tours specifically for young travellers to a wide variety of destinations. Some of the more popular ones are Travel For Teens, West Coast Connection, and Bold Earth. A quick internet search for "teen travel tour" should bring up dozens of other options.

		    	If you're travelling as part of a tour group, the destinations they offer should be listed on their website. There are tours for teens almost everywhere on Earth, so if you have a destination already in mind, it's just about finding the right company to take you there.

		    	Flights generally must be booked independently of the tour company, after you have already registered for the tour. Make sure that your flight's arrival date and time (not departure date and time) match the times your tour company gives you for pickup.
