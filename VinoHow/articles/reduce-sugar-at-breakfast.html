			<p class="p-intro">The average American’s sugar intake is about 60 pounds per year. However, it is recommended that men only consume about 9 teaspoons of sugar per day and women only about 6 teaspoons per day. This excess sugar can have many detrimental effects on your general health, as well as increasing your risk of developing serious medical conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. If you've decided to cut down on your sugar intake, breakfast is a good place to start. </p>

		    		<p>
		    			Any food product with more than 22.5g of sugar has a high sugar content and should be avoided – especially for breakfast. Eating something with that much sugar would mean you'd reached (or even exceeded, depending on the size of your portion) your daily allowance of sugar with the first meal of the day.
