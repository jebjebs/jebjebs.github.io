			<p class="p-intro">Picky eating is a problem that affects both children and adults, and can also have a negative effect on the people who eat with them or prepare their food. Children often need a bit of help to try new foods, so make eating fun and involve them in choosing ingredients. If you're trying to help an adult picky eater, encourage them to try new foods in different ways and provide non-judgmental support. In some cases, picky eating can be caused by an eating disorder called Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) that needs to be diagnosed and treated.</p>

		    	While getting kids to join the “clean plate club” might seem like a good idea, it can actually cause them to develop picky eating habits. Since being overfull can cause stomach pain or other gastrointestinal problems, children who've been encouraged to eat more than they need may slowly begin to dislike eating.

		    	New tastes, textures, and smells can be a little scary for children. Put very small portions of unfamiliar items on their plates, and don't make a big deal about the new arrival. You can also incorporate new foods into dishes that include items you know your kids like.

		    			For example, maybe your child has never had spinach. If you know they love creamy foods, try starting off with creamed spinach rather than a spinach salad. You can also try broccoli and cheese if they like cheesy flavors.

		    	Make your meals into a game! Rather than encouraging children to eat their carrots, tell them they need to eat “the orange food” to complete the rainbow. You can also use cookie cutters to transform unappealing items into circles, stars, or squares. Tell your child they need to “collect” each shape.

		    	This will help children to feel invested in what they eat. Especially when you're in the produce or meat sections, ask them to pick out a few ingredients that they'd like to try. Then, get them to help you pick out a recipe and prepare the meal. Later, if they say don't like something, remind them that they chose it. This may be enough to get them to eat at least a few bites.

		    	Bribing your children to eat just 2 more bites of peas in return for a bowl of ice cream isn't a good idea. This can make them feel like sweets are the best foods, which they probably don't need more prompting to believe! It might also cause them to expect dessert after every meal. Instead, make 1 or 2 nights a week "dessert nights."

		    	 Children learn by observation. If they see you eating a balanced mix of healthy foods, they'll be more likely to follow suit. However, watching you eating lots of soda, snack foods, and dessert will make them wonder why they can't do the same.
