			<p class="p-intro">Flexibility improves circulation, muscle health, and endurance, can help prevent injury, and perhaps even ward off arthritis and osteoporosis. Becoming more flexible involves daily routines and exercises designed to stretch the muscles and joints.</p>

		    	 In the past, athletes and fitness buffs were advised to stretch in a way that can actually hinder flexibility. This technique, known as static stretching, involved standing still and forcing muscles or joints into a stretch, might feel good in the moment and is great for targeting particular muscles.

		    	<!-- duplicate <li> if need more bullets -->

		    		<p>
		    			Instead of static stretching, which is about exertion into a stretch, you should think of stretching as a relaxing technique.

		    	</li>
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Put your body into a stretch position, and then ease into the stretch. You should stay focused and calm, without putting any exertion into your muscles or joints.

		    	 Yoga is about mind-body relaxation and discipline, and one major element of that process is proper breathing. In fact, proper breathing during yoga (and other stretching activities) can further the stretch itself by relaxing the body and increasing oxygen flow to the muscles under focus.
