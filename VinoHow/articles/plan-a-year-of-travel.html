				Spending an entire year traveling is a dream for many people. However, it requires a lot of preparation. Don't worry, though. If you stay organized and give yourself enough time, you can make this dream come true. Start planning a year in advance so you have time to outline and book your trip, get all of the documents you need, save up for travel expenses, and prepare for your big adventure.

		    	The first step in the planning stage is making a broad list of the countries and areas you’d like to visit. Since planning will take a long time, give yourself a year between starting the planning process and your eventual departure date. Discuss the plan with all of your travel companions and think about the places you’ve always wanted to go. Draw up a master list of locations that you want to visit during the year. 
		    </p>
		    <ul class="step-list">
		    	<!-- duplicate <li> if need more bullets -->
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			You may also want to visit multiple cities or sites in a single country. Account for that as well.
		    		</p>
		    	</li>
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			This list doesn’t have to be the final list of your destinations. It’s more of a brainstorming stage before hammering out more specifics. List all of the places you might want to go without limitations yet, then work on whittling the list down as you do more planning and see what's possible with your timeline and budget.

		    	Unfortunately, some places around the world are not safe to travel to. Some are active warzones, some are experiencing epidemics, and others are undergoing some form of unrest. Protect your safety by avoiding areas that have official travel advisories. Search for any advisories on countries that you’re considering visiting. If there is a high risk, remove those places from your itinerary.

		    <ul class="step-list">
		    	<!-- duplicate <li> if need more bullets -->
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Sometimes, only a certain area in a country has an advisory. In these cases, you may not have to eliminate the whole country from your list, just a certain region.

		    	<li>

		    	When you broadly know what countries and cities you’re visiting, then look at what you can do in each location.

		    	You’ll probably have to fly for at least part of the trip. Start looking at flights 3-6 months before your departure date to find the best deals and prices. Book all of them well in advance so all your travel is arranged before the trip.

		    	</li>
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Since you’re traveling for a year, you’ll probably have to book some flights while you’re traveling. Make sure you have a computer or another way to investigate flights.

		    	</li>
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			In general, don’t book flights more than 6 months in advance. You could miss out on price drops closer to the flight date.

		    		<p>
		    			You have many choices for lodging on your trip. Hotels give you a private room and accommodations. These range from budget to very expensive. Hostels are a cheaper option, but with less privacy.

		    <p class="step-details">
		    	Besides the main flight to start your trip, you then have to get from each location to the next. The way you travel depends on the location. Many places have train networks that can take you most places. Buses might be a cheaper option, but they can be slow and unreliable. For longer trips, another plane ride might be necessary. Investigate how you’ll get from one location to the next and book all the plans if you have to.

		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			For local travel, you don't have to worry about booking early to get cheaper prices because these prices usually don't fluctuate the way airline tickets do. However, keep expiration dates in mind. For example, don't buy a train ticket a year in advance if the ticket expires in 6 months. Check all those dates before booking, and get the tickets closer to your departure, if necessary.
		    		</p>
		    	</li>
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			You could also rent a car if you’re confident in your driving abilities. If you do rent a car, make sure to familiarize yourself with all the local driving laws. You don’t want to end up in legal trouble on vacation.

		    	</li>	
		    	<li>

		    	Even with perfect planning, emergencies can still happen while you’re overseas. Consulates and embassies from your home country can assist in emergency situations or if you end up stranded in a country without your documents. Look online to find the locations and contact information for every consulate in the countries you’re traveling to. If you experience an emergency while overseas, contact the consulate for assistance.

		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Consulates are able to issue emergency passports and travel documents if yours are lost or stolen, provide information about services in the country, give you legal advice, and help evacuate you in a disaster situation.

		    	<li>
		    		<p>
