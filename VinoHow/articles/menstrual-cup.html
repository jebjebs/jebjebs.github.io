			<p class="p-intro"> A menstrual cup collects menstrual fluid instead of absorbing it. You clean and reuse it, which means you don't need to replace it for a long time. Most people find they leak less than tampons and are more comfortable to wear. To use one, you'll insert it into your vaginal opening and twist it to make sure it sits right. Then, you can leave it in for as long as 12 hours before taking it out and emptying it. It may take time and practice to get used to using one, but menstrual cups are a highly sanitary and eco-friendly means of dealing with your period. </p>

		    	Menstrual cups are becoming more popular, so you should be able to find them in most drug stores and big box stores. Some are a bit smaller or larger, so it's always good to read reviews before deciding on one.

		    			Menstrual cups run $30-$40 USD, but keep in mind that you can use them over and over. However, you can get them cheaper, usually in the $7-$10 USD range on the low end, so look around if you just want to try one out.

		    			Menstrual cups are typically made of silicone or rubber. If you have latex allergies, make sure the cup you choose is made completely with silicone

		    	You can try the c-fold, where you squeeze the opening together then fold the opening in half. You can try the 7-fold, which is similar, but you bring one edge up higher, making the cup a bit narrower. Another option is the punch-down fold. Hold the cup between your thumb and middle finger, then press one edge down with your index finger, pushing it in toward the center of the cup.
