			<p class="p-intro">Having pristinely painted nails can really bring a whole look together. 
			However, having a bunch of nails with chipped polish can have the opposite effect, 
			making you look sloppy and unrefined. If is seems like every time you get a manicure at a salon, 
			or paint your own nails, your polish chips right away, then you need to make some changes. 
			Adjust how you paint your nails and how you care for them afterword in order to keep nail polish from chipping.</p>

		    	Professional nail salons have the right equipment to give you a long lasting coat of polish. 
				If you want a really long-lasting coat that doesn't chip, you can opt for a gel manicure, 
				which uses a super hard setting type of nail polish that acts almost like acrylic nails.

		    			If you are very dedicated to having long nails, you can get acrylic nails, 
						which are fake nails that are attached to your actual nails. These nails are very, 
						very strong but they cost more than a regular manicure and are quite a commitment.

		    	More expensive nail polishes usually contain more pigment, fewer potentially 
				toxic chemicals, and better brushes inside. That said, you don't need to spend 
				$50 to get a quality bottle of nail polish. Balance your budget with your desire 
				for a crisp and smooth manicure.

		    			Also avoid using quick-drying polish if you want to avoid chips. 
						The formula of quick-drying polish, while containing the same 
						ingredients as the regular, has different ratios of ingredients. 
						This difference in ratio makes the polish more likely to chip.

		    			Keep your nail polish from drying out by keeping the cap on the bottle 
						when you're not using the brush. Also, make sure to close the bottle tightly
						after you're finished applying your polish, and store the bottle out of sunlight.
