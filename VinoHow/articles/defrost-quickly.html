			<p class="p-intro">While it’s always better to defrost meat, vegetables, and frozen food in the refrigerator, sometimes you simply need to thaw some food fast. Meat can be quickly thawed in cold or warm water, although warm water is a little riskier if you let some of the water cool for too long. Veggies, thinner cuts of meat, noodles, and fruits can be easily defrosted in the microwave. When it comes to bread and other baked goods, opt for the oven to keep your items from getting soggy.</p>

		    	Open your freezer door with your plastic bag in hand. Place the frozen food inside a sealable plastic bag that will comfortably fit your food. You can use multiple plastic bags if you’d like to thaw multiple items at once. If you take the food out of the freezer and do this on the countertop, you could introduce bacteria into the bag, so do it in the freezer to keep your food safe.

		    	Take a large glass or metal bowl out of your cabinet. The container must be big enough to fully submerge your food in the water. Place your frozen food item at the bottom of the bowl. Turn your sink’s water on the coldest setting available and fill the bowl with the water.

		    	Once your bowl is filled with water, submerge your food in the water. Leave the bowl in your sink or on your countertop. The size, type, and density of your food will determine how long it takes to thaw. A 3–4 lb (1.4–1.8 kg) package of meat will take 2-3 hours to thaw, but smaller items may thaw in as little as 1 hour. Larger items, like frozen turkeys, may take up to 12 hours to thaw.

		    			You can tell if smaller food items are thawed by simply touching them. If they’re as soft as they’d be if they weren’t frozen, you’re good to go. Larger items may be frozen in the center though, making this method a poor choice for thicker foods.

		    	The goal when thawing food in cold water is to keep the water significantly colder than room temperature so that dangerous bacteria doesn’t grow in your food. To keep the water temperature under 40 °F (4 °C), which is the threshold for dangerous bacteria, drain the water while refilling it in your sink once every 30 minutes. This will ensure that your food stays cold as it thaws.
