			<p class="p-intro"> Aging is a natural part of life for both men and women, but that doesn't mean 
			it's always pleasant. If you're worried about losing your youthful looks and demeanor, then you're not alone. 
			Don't worry -- there's help along the way. There are plenty of things you can do to knock years 
			off your image without destroying your bank account or getting surgery, like taking attentive care 
			of your skin and changing up your hairstyle.</p>

		    <p class="step-details">
		    	Aging skin does not need harsh products like the ones teenagers often need to use, 
				as there isn't usually any excess oil. If your cleanser is too harsh, it will be 
				stripping your skin of its natural oils, and therefore drying out the skin and causing 
				it to age more quickly. Look for ones that are aimed at your age group, or ones that 
				describe themselves as gentle or moisturizing. Women should moisturize their faces any 
				time before they wear make-up..

		    			It is still important to cleanse your face as you get older, as it removes 
						traces of chemicals from your environment or any makeup which can cause aging

		    	It's important to give your skin a moisture boost so that it can look after itself. 
				Dry skin ages more quickly if it's not moisturized. Look for anti-aging moisturizers
				with a high percentage of their active ingredient. If in doubt about which to buy 
				(there are hundreds on the market), try looking at reviews or try to find scientific 
				research supporting the product. Make sure that the product you decide on is rich and 
				deeply moisturizing, unlike the ones you may have used in your younger years.

		    	Gently exfoliating encourages skin cell renewal, therefore encouraging younger looking skin. 
				Choose something that is aimed at older skin as they are more gentle and less likely to dry 
				out or damage the skin. Exfoliation is also good to do as it leaves your skin feeling softer 
				and looking brighter. For men, exfoliating before shaving your face can make the shaving process 
				easier as it exposes more of the hair.

		    	For men, this will make you look better groomed and less scruffy allowing you 
				to look good with age, and for women, this will hide this side effect of aging.

		    <ul class="step-list">
		    	<!-- duplicate <li> if need more bullets -->
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Men: Keep your face clean shaven or neatly trimmed, and always trim 
						your nose and ear hair. You can buy nose hair trimmers at your local
						pharmacy and itâ€™s completely simple and painless to use. Letting this 
						hair grow wild adds age and also makes you look more scruffy. Make 
						sure to pluck those nose hairs too, if you want to avoid that old man look.
		    		</p>
		    	</li>
				<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Women: Facial hair can sometimes appear in women after menopause due to 
						a change in hormone levels. To get rid of this, and therefore hide your 
						age a little better, there are a few easy ways to keep it away including 
						laser removal, waxing, depilatory/hair removal cream, and threading.

		    	This isn't for everyone, as some people love to rock their grey or peppery hair. 
				However, many people want to get rid of grey hair, and there are many hair dyes 
				on the market that can tackle it. It's best to choose a color that is fairly similar 
				to what your natural hair color was so that it appears more natural. You could 
				choose to get your hair dyed at a salon, or you could choose the cheaper option and 
				buy an at-home hair dying kit. You must remember, however, that all hair dye is damaging 
				to the hair, so avoid dying it too often, and use products designed to care for damaged or dyed hair.

		    <ul class="step-list">
		    	<!-- duplicate <li> if need more bullets -->
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			As a way of avoiding dying your hair too often, you can apply hair dye 
						primarily to the roots where your real hair color is showing, leave it there 
						for longer, and then work the rest through the hair for the last few minutes. 
						Another alternative is to buy root touch-up kits that match the hair dye you used.

		    	Have you been rocking "The Rachel" for the last twenty years? If so, then you're overdue 
				for a trendier haircut that can make the most of your youthful face and features. 
				Check out some stylish magazines or even some celebrity gossip magazines and see what 
				hairstyles are popular these days. You don't have to go for something ultra-trendy if 
				that's not your thing, but getting a haircut that suits you better than your old one can 
				make you look a decade younger. Here are some things to consider when you go for a new haircut:
		    </p>
		    <ul class="step-list">
		    	<!-- duplicate <li> if need more bullets -->
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Women: Consider getting bangs if you have a larger forehead and if they fit your 
						face shape. They will make you look more youthful.

		    		</p>
		    	</li>
				<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Layers can also take years off the age you look. They'll make your hair look 
						more textured, airy, and voluminous, and will get rid of that flat, stringy 
						look your hair might be suffering from.
		    		</p>
		    	</li>
				<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Men: Let your hair grow out just a bit so your features look less harsh. 
						But don't let your hair get too shaggy or you'll look a bit more haggard and old.

		    		</p>
		    	</li>
				<li>
		    		<p>
		    			If you're going bald, consider shaving your head. This will make you look younger -- 
						and sexier -- instead of just letting your bald spot show.
