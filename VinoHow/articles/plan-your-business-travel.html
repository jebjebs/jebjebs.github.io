				Planning a work-related trip can be a stressful endeavor. On top of your usual travel concerns, you also have to keep your mind focused on the business aspect of your trip. Business travel doesn't have to be stressful, though. With a little planning and preparation, you can help ensure your trip runs as smoothly as possible so you can stay focused on your work.

		    	Depending on where you're traveling to, you may need to make certain accommodations for yourself. This is usually more important for international travel, but it may be relevant for domestic travel as well.

		    			If traveling to a city at an elevation above 4,900 feet (1,500 meters), you may be susceptible to elevation sickness. Try to give yourself a few days to acclimate before doing anything strenuous and start drinking two to three liters of water each day to stay hydrated.

		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			If you're traveling outside the country, find out if you can safely drink the tap water where you'll be. If not, you'll need to stick to bottled, purified water to stay healthy.

		    	Having an itinerary is the easiest way to ensure that you remain on schedule and don't forget any important tasks on your trip. Knowing where to go and what to do, as well as what time everything needs to happen by, will help streamline your travel plans from start to finish.

		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			When booking your hotel, see if you can use sky miles or get points towards a rewards program. You should also make note of your hotel's policies on check-in, checkout, parking, and number of people per room.

		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			If you need a rental car, make sure that all the roads you'll be driving will be safe with your rental car. Research if you need two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. Look around with different rental car companies to see which has the best rate.
