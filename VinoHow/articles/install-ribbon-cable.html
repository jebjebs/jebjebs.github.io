			<p class="p-intro">They’re generally considered obsolete these days, but you may occasionally find them inside some TVs, laptops, gaming systems, and printers. Replacing a ribbon cable is deceptively simple, but you may need to attach a new connector if the cable doesn’t slide directly into a clip on your electronic device. Also, be sure to install the new ribbon cable the same direction and way the old cable was installed.</p>

		    	At the end of the ribbon cable where it connects to the electronic, there is a horizontal strip of plastic with little rivets sticking out of it. This is the cable clip. Put the tip of your index finger in the middle of these rivets and gently pull it upwards. Apply light pressure and pull gently to unlock the clip. Slide the old cable out of the clip.

		    			This process only applies to ribbon cables that do not have a connector on the end. If you don’t have a rectangular piece of plastic or metal on the end of the cable itself, you do not have a connector.

		    	Take your replacement ribbon cable and turn it so that it’s facing the same direction as the old cable with the colors laying the exact same way. With the clip unlocked, lower the end of the cable underneath the clip. Slide the cable through the base of the clip using the horizontal slot near the base of the panel that the clip is attached to.

		    			This is typically pretty easy. You can see the opening where the cable slides in just by looking at the base of the clip.

		    	Push the cable through the clip until the tip of the cable pops out on the other side. Keep sliding the cable through until it hits the small vertical lip. This is the guideline for the cable, and the end of the cable must rest flush against the lip. Adjust the cable as needed until the end of the ribbon cable matches the guide line.

		    			This may sound odd, but if there’s no guideline just push the cable to the other side and let it sit anywhere that it fits. When you install a ribbon cable, there are pins on the clip that puncture the cords to form an electrical connection. You can theoretically install the clip on any part of the ribbon cable.

		    	Put your finger on the rivets you used to pry the cable clip off. Lower the rivets down towards the side that they originally rested. Press the clip down gently until it clicks into place. The pins underneath the clip will puncture the ribbon cable and create an electrical connection between the cable and the electronic component.

		    	Most of the time, you merely need to run the cable to another cable clip on your electronic device. To attach the other end of the clip, repeat these steps by popping the second clip up and sliding the other end of the cable into the slot before closing it. If the cable runs to another panel or electronic device, attach the clip before screwing or assembling the new portion of the device.

		    			On a TV, this cable typically runs from the screen to the motherboard. On a computer, these cables connect the screen and keyboard to the motherboard. You usually don’t need to install new components for these repairs.

		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			On a printer or gaming system, the ribbon clip often connects two panels together to power up buttons. Attach both ends of the cable using your clips before screwing in or assembling the device.
