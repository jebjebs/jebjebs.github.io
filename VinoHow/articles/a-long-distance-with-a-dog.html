				Whether you are moving across the country or taking a road trip, traveling can be a stressful activity. Traveling with your dog can add even more of a burden to your trip. If you want to travel a long distance with your dog, make sure they have all of their vaccinations, pack up their essentials, and tire them out before you start your trip. If you are going by car, be sure they have plenty of food, water, and shade. If you are traveling by plane, check with your airline to figure out what restrictions and guidelines you need to follow.

		    	It is important to make sure your dog will be happy and healthy during their travels. Take your dog to the vet to make sure they are up to date on their vaccinations so that they are protected against any new germs they may come into contact with. Vaccines for rabies, canine hepatitis, and canine distemper are all standard.

		    	If you’ve taken your dogs on shorter car rides before, you may have noticed that they get sick from the motion of the car. Ask your vet if they could prescribe something for your dog to help ease their stomach while in motion. Most often this is a pill that you give your dog every few hours during a car or plane ride.

		    	Every dog is different and requires different essential items. Make sure you have your dog’s food, some water, 2 dishes, their leash and harness, poop bags, toys, and treats in a bag. Keep this bag in an easy-to-reach space so you can take items out as you need them on your trip.

		    			If your dog has a medical condition, get a copy of their medical history from your vet in case there’s an emergency. Make sure the history includes any diagnoses, tests done on your dog, and the medication dosages it needs.
