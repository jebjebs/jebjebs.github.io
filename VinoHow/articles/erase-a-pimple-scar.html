Whether your acne scars are recent or they've been there for a while, there are treatments you can use which can help them fade or even disappear completely.</p>

			<h2 class="step-title">Reduce redness. </h2>

		    	Fight the redness of a blemish by applying cortisone cream. Cortisone will help to fight inflammation and will reduce the surrounding redness of the scar, making it appear less noticeable.
		    </p>
		    <ul class="step-list">
		    	<!-- duplicate <li> if need more bullets -->
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			You will be able to buy cortisone cream without a prescription, at most pharmacies. It should cost about $10.
		    		</p>
		    	</li>
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Look for creams that are labelled as “non-comedogenic,” which means that they avoid ingredients that can clog pores, like cocoa butter, coal tar, isopropyl myristate, and pigments and dyes. Treating your scars while at the same time causing more acne is like fighting a losing battle.

		    <!-- duplicate .step-details if need more paragraph -->
		    <p class="step-details">
		    	Another tool in your arsenal is fade creams. Fade creams that contain kojic acid or arbutin will help to lighten the pigment of the blemished skin, and therefore reduce its visibility.
		    </p>
		    <ul class="step-list">
		    	<!-- duplicate <li> if need more bullets -->
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Such creams, again, should be available at your local pharmacy for a fairly low cost.
		    		</p>
		    	</li>
				<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Be careful of hydroquinone. Hydroquinone skin fading topicals are fade creams that lighten pigments in the skin; however, they have recently fallen out of favor due to concerns about possible cancer-causing properties.

			<h3 class="step-num">STEP 3</h3>
			<h2 class="step-title">Use vitamin C. </h2>

		    <!-- duplicate .step-details if need more paragraph -->
		    <p class="step-details">
		    	Ascorbic acid, or simply vitamin C, may be an effective way to fade or even remove acne scars and can be found in something as simply as lemon juice. Vitamin C not only contains antioxidants and reduces inflammation but it is essential in the production of collagen, which the body uses to heal connective tissue.
		    </p>
		    <ul class="step-list">
		    	<!-- duplicate <li> if need more bullets -->
		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			You can buy specially formulated vitamin C skin creams or serums at drugstores and pharmacies.
		    		</p>
		    	</li>
				<li>
		    		<p>
		    			An even simpler method is to apply lemon juice to your face with a cotton swab, after a thorough cleansing, leaving it for no longer than a half hour. You may feel some stinging or discomfort. Your skin may also dry out, so you should apply moisturizer afterward.
		    		</p>
		    	</li>
				<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun while using lemon juice to lighten your skin. Prolonged sunlight is bad for your acne scars as it is, but with lemon juice on your skin, it's particularly bad.
		    		</p>
		    	</li>
				<li>
		    		<p>
		    			Like many topical treatments, results are not immediate but regular safe use can help prevent and treat acne.
		    		</p>
		    	</li>

			<h3 class="step-num">STEP 4</h3>
			<h2 class="step-title">Avoid creams with vitamin E.  </h2>

		    <div class="step-img" style="background-image: url('../images/vite.jpg')"></div>
		    <!-- duplicate .step-details if need more paragraph -->
		    <p class="step-details">
		    	Creams with vitamin E may actually do more harm than good. Because it's a vitamin, we're tempted to think that it will be either beneficial or harmless. In fact, one University of Miami study reported that vitamin E treatment had no effect or worsened the appearance of scars in 90% of subjects, with improvement in only 10% of cases </p>
