		    <p class="step-details">
		    	Sometimes, you just need a basic cable management solution. If you've got wires hanging from your PC down behind your desk, stick cable catches on the back of the furniture. These look like small circles with a slit across the center. Stick the flat side of the catch to your desk. Then, push the wires through the slit so they run down the length of the desk instead of dangling.

		    <ul class="step-list">

		    	<li>
		    		<p>
		    			This is also a great option if your desk is in the middle of your room. The cable catch will be visible from one side, but your wires won't be visible from the front of the desk!

		    <p class="step-details">
		    	If your desk is pushed right up against a wall, you've probably got PC wires hanging over the sides of the desk. For a permanent storage solution, drill a circular hole into the top of the desk near the back. You'll probably want to do this right behind the computer so the hole isn't noticeable. Then, push the wires down through the hole so they hang below the desk. This way, you won't see wires cluttering the top of your workspace.

		    	 If your desk is in the middle of the room, you'll have cords that you need to run to outlets. Buy a long cord protector and lay a strip of double-sided tape on the ground. Press the cord protector on the tape so it lies flat. Then, push the wires into the protector so it surrounds them. This also works if your desk is against a wall and you want to hide the wires that run to the closest outlet.

		    	The tray looks like a long compartment that you screw to the underside of your desk or table. Then, feed the wires into the compartment so it holds them. You won't be able to see the wires when you're sitting at the desk.

		    <p class="step-details">
		    	Even after you hide most of the wires in a tray or box, you'll still have wires hanging from the PC to the storage system. To clean them up, pinch the hanging wires together and wrap them with a plastic zip tie or rubber tie. This makes them look more organized. To hide them even more, you can stick the gathered wires to the back of a desk with the double-sided tape trick.

		    <p class="step-details">
		    	It's hard to completely hide all of the wires coming from your computer. Once you've stored the bulk of them, you can deal with the straggling wires. For something more decorative than a zip tie, take a strip of braided sleeving or a piece of split tubing. Gather the wires and place them in the center of the sleeving or tubing. Then, wrap the material around the wires to hide them and give your wires a more polished look.

		    	If you don't feel like buying specialized cable management items, grab a few big binder clips from your desk. Gather the wires that are hanging from your PC and clip them together. Then, pull back one of the binder handles and press it flush against the back of your desk. Hammer a nail into the desk so the binder clip hangs from it and hides your cords.
