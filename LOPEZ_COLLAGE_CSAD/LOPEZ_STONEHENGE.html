				<h1>Stonehenge</h1>
				<h3>Wiltshire, England</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="intro">
				<p>Stonehenge is one of those places that makes you ponder what went on here over 4,500 years ago. It's long been a mystery to historians, and has captured the imagination of countless visitors. Despite the large number of tourists that descend on Stonehenge, the place still has a mystical feel.</p>
					
				<p>At the site, giant stones, some standing, some fallen, are set in two roughly circular patterns that are oriented to highlight the summer and winter solstices. For a truly memorable experience, plan your visit during one of these times.</p>
					
				<p>An easy day trip from London, Stonehenge can easily be worked into your UK itinerary.</p>

			<h2>Getting there</h2>
			<p>There is no universal best option to visit Stonehenge from London. However, a tour is going to be both a cheaper and faster way of visiting Stonehenge from London than visiting independently. So for most visitors a tour bus is the ideal solution.</p>
			
			<p>Many travellers are just not compatible with coach tours and prefer the independent approach with the flexibility to see things at your own pace, pause a while and ponder and generally decide their own schedule. The key point to make though is that with Stonehenge you will be paying a price premium over a tour for this flexibility.</p>
			
			<p>Independently from London you take the train from London's Waterloo Station to Salisbury, nine miles from Stonehenge. From there you need to take the Stonehenge tour bus which takes you directly from Salisbury to Stonehenge Visitor Centre. There are no public buses to Stonehenge itself.</p>
